# ModellBahn
ModellBahn
An educational project to learn about REST and Web apps.
Aims to replace those features of Modellbahnverwaltung MoVe (http://www.henningvoosen.de/Site/Downloads/Modellbahnverwaltung.htm) by Henning Voosen that I use with something cross platform (and not obsolete).

The plan:

Server:
Phase 1:
Implement with Jackson / Jetty / Jersey / Hibernate / JPA / HK2 and Swagger so we learn the basics (and prove the requirements).

Phase 2:
Change to SpringBoot

Phase 3:
Make multi user and add Spring Security
Change HK2 to Mongo or someother NoSQL
Use docker and/or cloud deployment

UI:
Phase 1:
Basics in HTML / jQuery

Phase 2:
React / Redux / Node.js

Phase 3:
WebPack?

Other niceness:
Along the way add JUnits / Cucumber / Selenium
See if we can shrink a single user deployment on an Android phone?

All comers welcome.
